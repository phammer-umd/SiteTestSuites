# SiteTestSuites
A collection of Silenium tests for wwwprod and digitalprod.

They provide a fairly minimal test for each page: Does it open, does the title match, and is there a heading in the content area somewhere.

- In the Silenium IDE, choose to open a test suite, choose one of the test suites in the appropriate folder with the a- prefix.
- Run the test suite
- It will replace the front most tab in Firefox.
- Look at the pages as they fly by to see if there are any unusual dispolays or lack of displays.
